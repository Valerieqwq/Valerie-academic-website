I am an undergraduate student majored in Psychology in Beijing Normal University. Broadly, my research interests involve the study of mechanisms that how we learn and remember everything, as well as the general cognitive mechanisms underlined our daily activities. In addition, I have a particular interest in aesthetic perceptions of  art, music or any object that can give rise to aesthetic judgments and its neural bases. Also, I am interested in how to make human feel better and really enjoy their lives, like studying the roles individual differences variables (e.g., optimism, perfectionism, coping) play in positive and negative mental health. 

Currently I work as a research assistant supervised by Professor [Gui Xue](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=Gyms-jgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), here we use EEG and other brain imaging methods to explore the neural mechanism underlined human memory. Also, I am supervised by Professor [Ke Zhou](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=QSngYiAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) doing research about how attention may alter our perception of numerosity and its neural mechanism. Except working in the lab in BNU, I keep in touch with another professor, [Edward C. Chang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Jcy5PMMAAAAJ), who is a professor in Department of Psychology in University of Michigan, we have been working with a project about how negative affects can benefit people and have positive influences.
